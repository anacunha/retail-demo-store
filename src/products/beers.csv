Every aspect of the brewing process of the family-owned Trumer Brauerei in Salzburg has been recreated with exacting detail at the Trumer Brauerei Berkeley. Trumer Pils is the wonderful result of a unique and special brewing process, which sets it apart from other beers. Like champagne, the quality of a great Pilsner can be seen in the density of its bubbles. Trumer Pils produces small, tight bubbles that rise from the bottom of the glass, delivering a slightly spicy aroma, with a hint of citrus. This perfect balance of flavors is achieved by procuring the exact blend of malt and hops from Germany and Austria and fermenting the brew with proprietary yeast. Its body is accentuated by using pure, soft water and removing the malt husk prior to the mashing process. The signature of Trumer Pils is its finish. The crisp, clean and well-rounded taste leaves just a subtle touch of soft bitter flavor on the back of the palate. However, because the husk is removed before mashing, the finish won’t linger. Trumer Pils is a testament to the dedication of its Austrian and American brewmasters. The result? A true European Pilsner without compare.",4.9,26

Until 1960, the Belgium government controlled an area in Africa known, then, as the Belgian Congo. In 1915, in the deep and dark recesses of a mine in Shinkolobwe, Congo, the world's largest and richest deposit of Uranium was discovered. The need for Uranium at the time was limited and the mine was mostly used to recover Radium (another radioactive element) until nuclear fission was discovered in 1938. The discovery of nuclear fission hinted at the ""explosive"" power of Uranium and in 1942 the US Military, committed to launching The Manhattan Project, decided to buy up all the Uranium they could get their hands on. The US government worked a deal with the Belgian and British powers controlling the mine, securing 4,200 tons of Congolese Uranium. Those 4,200 tons would form the basis of material used to research, develop, and create the explosive components of the atomic bomb. While searching for a rich deposit of our own, we ""dug"" into the recesses of our dark beer catalog and mined this 8.5% ABV Belgian Strong Dark Ale.

The Calutron Girls were a group of young women who, due to labor shortages during WW2, were recruited to work at the top-secret Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, TN. These young girls, many of whom had barely graduated high school, were tasked with monitoring and adjusting the dials and meters on a mass spectrometer that produced the enriched uranium used in the first Atomic bomb. They did all this with an extremely high level of efficiency, with ZERO knowledge of their true job function or what the dials they were monitoring and adjusting controlled. A manager at the Oak Ridge facility reportedly would tell new Calutron girls, “We can train you how to do what is needed, but cannot tell you what you are doing. I can only tell you that if our enemies beat us to it, God have mercy on us!” This beer is dedicated to the many unsung and under-appreciated contributions made by so many women during the war effort.",5.0,18

This malt bill, combined with one of the world’s most perfect yeast strains, brings out the classic notes of clove and banana that you expect, while mangoes provide the fruitiness and mild tartness that you don't. The Mango addition makes this wheat beer standout and the name celebrates the exceptional……the Calutron Girls.

1c80453e-9fda-4a76-89cb-5e24a10ec98b,Ententanz Oktoberfest,Able Baker Brewing Company,Seasonal,Lager - Festbier,"Sometimes a story just tells itself. In the late 1950's Swiss accordion player Werner Thomas penned a tune called ""Der Ententanz"" (The Duck Dance) because, in addition to accordion playing, he also tended flocks of ducks and geese. Thomas began playing the composition in local hotels and restaurants where guests created a dance to the bouncy tune that, they believed, mimicked the movements of a duck. The dance eventually grew to include beak, wing, and tail motions. By the late 70's, the tune had become a popular drinking song at Oktoberfest and Germans had given the song a new name, ""Vogerltanz"" (Little Bird Dance). The dance made its way to the United States in 1981 via an Oktoberfest celebration held in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Founding members of that Oktoberfest celebration wanted to demonstrate their love of the song through a dance performed in costume, but no duck costumes were available. Luckily, a local TV Station had a chicken costume to donate and the ""Chicken Dance"" was born (this is a true story). Our Oktoberfest style beer is meant to mimic the fun and enthusiasm experienced by those who enjoy this, now, ubiquitous Oktoberfest dance. Classic ingredients like Vienna and Munich malts, Hallertau hops, and German Lager yeast pay tribute to Old-World elements that will have you ""flapping your wings"" for tradition, while the 6% ABV provides you with just enough liquid courage to ""shake your tailfeather"" and celebrate the new. Crisp, clean, and malt driven with a beautifully dry finish, this copper colored Festbier is our ""Prost!"" to you.",6.0,14

That's both the name of our German style Pilsner as well as the condition you'll achieve after tasting it. We start with an elegantly traditional base and add just a touch of Vienna Malt (for a bit more toasted malt character) then hop this crisp, easy drinking lager with Hallertau Mittelfruh and Saphir for a distinctive yet smooth flavor and bitterness. When excited state atoms decay the excess energy is released in the form of gamma rays and fluorescence. While we promise that you won't ""hulk out"" after drinking this brew, you may choose to sip and bask in the ""glow"" of the excess energy this beer possesses.",5.0,30
