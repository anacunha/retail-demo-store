    comes from the heavy-handed dose of hops in the kettle, hop back and multiple
    dry hop additions. A slightly sweet finish helps to balance the hop bitterness
    and creates and ale that is big on flavor yet remains highly drinkable.

    included a sampling of AleSmith beers to identify Tony’s preferences. He wanted
    the beer to be “light with a kick” which he elaborated further to mean full of
    hop character and light in body and color. The result of the Gwynn family’s feedback
    on test batches rendered a golden pale ale full of American hop flavor and aroma,
    with a subdued bitterness and a malty sweet finish. AleSmith San Diego Pale Ale
    .394 pays tribute to the city that Tony loved and the career-high batting average
    that he achieved in ‘94. Discover what happens when a Hall of Fame perfectionist

    kicked and our original best seller! Its cloudy appearance isn’t transparent,
    but we’d like to be. We don’t brew Hefeweizen for any other reason than this…
    WE… LOVE… HEFEWEIZEN! We love the apricot our yeast strain presents alongside
    it’s banana, clove, bubble gum and vanilla aromas. We love the rich and fresh
    doughy malt character with ever so earthy and floral hop flavors. We love that
    we can pack so much flavor and aroma into such a refreshing pint AND we think
    you’ll love it too!

  description: Hoppy Times is a classic West Coast IPA with some modern flare. We
    don’t beat you over the head with giant bittering additions. Bone dry attenuation,
    and water chemistry favoring sulfates helps deliver the balance we achieve. We
    then pass those hop savings right back to you in the form of late kettle or dry
    hop additions. Palisade, Citra, Cascade, and Chinook come together for an orange
    and pine party with subtler aromas of lime, grapefruit rind, pineapple, and apricot.
    If this beer isn’t hoppy enough, it’s you not us. This beer is ALWAYS 21 days
    or younger in our taproom.

  description: What the hell is “craft lager” anyway? Why is it so frequently tied
    to a bland and boring beer? Let’s stop mailing it in, and halfheartedly making
    swill while trying to pass it off as “craft” beer. How about if we want to make
    a “craft lager”, we actually CRAFT a LAGER! Rant over and wish granted! The Ringer
    is our meticulously hand crafted, take on a traditional German style Pilsner.
    All pilsner malt with a touch of Munich, to add a little bit of rich toastiness
    to that crisp and snappy malt flavor that sits as an elegant & graceful backbone
    for beautiful hop bouquet. Spalt Select & crystal are sprinkled through the boil
    for the modern, yet familiar noble hop character. At the end of the boil, we bring
    those two back and add a larger dose of Mandarina Bavaria for a touch tangerine.
    Modern yet traditional. Crisp and effervescent. Easy and nuanced. One and another.
    Cheers!

  description: The sparkling mouth feel of each sip confirms the dedication to traditional
    European craftsmanship. Every aspect of the brewing process of the family-owned
    Trumer Brauerei in Salzburg has been recreated with exacting detail at the Trumer
    Brauerei Berkeley. Trumer Pils is the wonderful result of a unique and special
    brewing process, which sets it apart from other beers. Like champagne, the quality
    of a great Pilsner can be seen in the density of its bubbles. Trumer Pils produces
    small, tight bubbles that rise from the bottom of the glass, delivering a slightly
    spicy aroma, with a hint of citrus. This perfect balance of flavors is achieved
    by procuring the exact blend of malt and hops from Germany and Austria and fermenting
    the brew with proprietary yeast. Its body is accentuated by using pure, soft water
    and removing the malt husk prior to the mashing process. The signature of Trumer
    Pils is its finish. The crisp, clean and well-rounded taste leaves just a subtle
    touch of soft bitter flavor on the back of the palate. However, because the husk
    is removed before mashing, the finish won’t linger. Trumer Pils is a testament
    to the dedication of its Austrian and American brewmasters. The result? A true
    European Pilsner without compare.

  description: All atmospheric nuclear explosions produce a unique and easy to detect
    emission signature, consisting of an extremely brief and intense initial "flash"
    followed by a 2nd much longer and less intense "flash" of light (the visible fireball).
    These dual explosions of light are known as "double flashes". This phenomenon
    is unique to nuclear explosions and impossible to recreate artificially, allowing
    researchers, scientists, tracking satellites, and governments to confirm if and
    where a nuclear explosion has taken place. While not emitting light, our "Double
    Flash" Dubbel does explode into a deep amber color and tasteful fireball of classic
    Belgian flavors. The term Dubbel is a Trappist beer naming convention originally
    used to identify beers with a higher alcohol content. We match that required "emission
    signature" here as we produce this 7% ABV, classically style Trappist ale. We
    use a unique combination of Victory, Munich, Belgian Aromatic, and a touch of
    Dark Crystal malt to create a complex but dry malt character. The Belgian yeast
    strain produces fruity esters that give you a "Double Flash" of flavor, evoking
    notes of plum and spice. This brew is easy to track, no satellites necessary,
    just flash down to our taproom for a pour.

  description: Belgium has a strange connection to the development of the atomic bomb.
    Until 1960, the Belgium government controlled an area in Africa known, then, as
    the Belgian Congo. In 1915, in the deep and dark recesses of a mine in Shinkolobwe,
    Congo, the world's largest and richest deposit of Uranium was discovered. The
    need for Uranium at the time was limited and the mine was mostly used to recover
    Radium (another radioactive element) until nuclear fission was discovered in 1938.
    The discovery of nuclear fission hinted at the "explosive" power of Uranium and
    in 1942 the US Military, committed to launching The Manhattan Project, decided
    to buy up all the Uranium they could get their hands on. The US government worked
    a deal with the Belgian and British powers controlling the mine, securing 4,200
    tons of Congolese Uranium. Those 4,200 tons would form the basis of material used
    to research, develop, and create the explosive components of the atomic bomb.
    While searching for a rich deposit of our own, we "dug" into the recesses of our
    dark beer catalog and mined this 8.5% ABV Belgian Strong Dark Ale. You don't have
    to dig too deep to discover that sweet malt and dark fruit flavors dominate this
    Mahogany colored "ore", as prevalent spicy, yet fruity, aromas are expressed then
    complemented by a rich caramel malt backbone.

  description: This Bavarian style Hefeweizen was brewed with a traditional approach,
    combining Munich malt, lots of wheat, and Weihenstephan yeast. This malt bill,
    combined with one of the world’s most perfect yeast strains, brings out all the
    classic, traditional notes of clove and banana that you expect from this style.
    While our brewing process values tradition, this name celebrates the exceptional……the
    Calutron Girls. The Calutron Girls were a group of young women who, due to labor
    shortages during WW2, were recruited to work at the top-secret Y-12 National Security
    Complex in Oak Ridge, TN. These young girls, many of whom had barely graduated
    high school, were tasked with monitoring and adjusting the dials and meters on
    a mass spectrometer that produced the enriched uranium used in the first Atomic
    bomb. They did all this with an extremely high level of efficiency, with ZERO
    knowledge of their true job function or what the dials they were monitoring and
    adjusting controlled. A manager at the Oak Ridge facility reportedly would tell
    new Calutron girls, “We can train you how to do what is needed, but cannot tell
    you what you are doing. I can only tell you that if our enemies beat us to it,
    God have mercy on us!” This beer is dedicated to the many unsung and under-appreciated
    contributions made by so many women during the war effort.

  style: Hefeweizen
  description: This fruited Hefeweizen was brewed with some traditional approaches
    (Munich malt, lots of wheat, and Weihenstephan yeast) and some non-traditional
    ones (Mangoes). This malt bill, combined with one of the world’s most perfect
    yeast strains, brings out the classic notes of clove and banana that you expect,
    while mangoes provide the fruitiness and mild tartness that you don't. The Mango
    addition makes this wheat beer standout and the name celebrates the exceptional……the
    Calutron Girls. The Calutron Girls were a group of young women who, due to labor
    shortages during WW2, were recruited to work at the top-secret Y-12 National Security

  name: Ententanz Oktoberfest
  brewery: Able Baker Brewing Company
  category: seasonal
  style: Lager - Festbier
  description: Sometimes a story just tells itself. In the late 1950's Swiss accordion
    player Werner Thomas penned a tune called "Der Ententanz" (The Duck Dance) because,
    in addition to accordion playing, he also tended flocks of ducks and geese. Thomas
    began playing the composition in local hotels and restaurants where guests created
    a dance to the bouncy tune that, they believed, mimicked the movements of a duck.
    The dance eventually grew to include beak, wing, and tail motions. By the late
    70's, the tune had become a popular drinking song at Oktoberfest and Germans had
    given the song a new name, "Vogerltanz" (Little Bird Dance). The dance made its
    way to the United States in 1981 via an Oktoberfest celebration held in Tulsa,
    Oklahoma. Founding members of that Oktoberfest celebration wanted to demonstrate
    their love of the song through a dance performed in costume, but no duck costumes
    were available. Luckily, a local TV Station had a chicken costume to donate and
    the "Chicken Dance" was born (this is a true story). Our Oktoberfest style beer
    is meant to mimic the fun and enthusiasm experienced by those who enjoy this,
    now, ubiquitous Oktoberfest dance. Classic ingredients like Vienna and Munich
    malts, Hallertau hops, and German Lager yeast pay tribute to Old-World elements
    that will have you "flapping your wings" for tradition, while the 6% ABV provides
    you with just enough liquid courage to "shake your tailfeather" and celebrate
    the new. Crisp, clean, and malt driven with a beautifully dry finish, this copper
    colored Festbier is our "Prost!" to you.

  description: In atomic terminology, when an atom or nucleus possesses more than
    its normal energy it enters into an "excited state". That's both the name of our
    German style Pilsner as well as the condition you'll achieve after tasting it.
    We start with an elegantly traditional base and add just a touch of Vienna Malt
    (for a bit more toasted malt character) then hop this crisp, easy drinking lager
    with Hallertau Mittelfruh and Saphir for a distinctive yet smooth flavor and bitterness.
    When excited state atoms decay the excess energy is released in the form of gamma
    rays and fluorescence. While we promise that you won't "hulk out" after drinking
    this brew, you may choose to sip and bask in the "glow" of the excess energy this
    beer possesses.

  description: 'The intersection of astronomy and atomic energy: Gamma Ray Burst.
    In the 1960s the USA launched top-secret satellites to detect gamma radiation
    from Soviet warhead testing. Scientists recorded numerous gamma bursts but they
    emanated from an extraterrestrial origin! Declassified in the 1970s, astronomers
    discovered the bursts were the result of supernovae and black hole collisions.
    This Tripel won''t explode in your glass but it will "burst" with traditional
    Belgian characteristics you love: fruity esters, spicy phenols, and noticeable
    alcohol. This brew might take you to new worlds but won''t leave you stranded
    because its recipe is "based on real science"!'
